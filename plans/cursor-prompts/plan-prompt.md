"Create a comprehensive development guide for [PROJECT NAME], following the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) methodology. The guide should be divided into [NUMBER] logical parts, with each part focusing on different phases of development. For each task in the guide: 1. Add priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low) 2. Include effort estimates in days 3. Add clear success criteria that define when a task is complete The guide should be structured with checkboxes for each task and subtask, making it easy to track progress. Avoid code snippets and focus on clear, actionable descriptions. Each part should include: - An introduction explaining that phase’s focus - Major components to be developed in that phase - Detailed task breakdowns with subtasks - Dependencies between tasks (if applicable) - A brief overview of what’s coming in the next part The project involves [BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF YOUR PROJECT, TECHNOLOGIES, AND GOALS]. Start with Part 1 focusing on [INITIAL PHASE FOCUS, e.g., “setting up the core infrastructure and foundation”]. After completing each part, wait for my confirmation before proceeding to the next part.

THEN

Process each task in the @.cursor-tasks file sequentially. Do not take screenshots after completing tasks or stories. Follow our security best practices for all implementations, especially Row Level Security policies in Supabase and proper authentication checks in Workers. When working with AI APIs, implement cost-efficient patterns with proper caching and error handling. Mark completed task with [x] in the .cursor-tasks file Maintain existing formatting and indentation.
